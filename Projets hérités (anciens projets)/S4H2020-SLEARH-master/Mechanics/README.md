ASSEMBLY OF THE HAND

1. Start by opening the BOM file in this folder.
2. With a 3D printer at 40% fill and supports, print all the parts that have &quot;3D printed&quot; as a link. Some parts need to be printed more than once, refer to the quantity column of the BOM to know how many.
3. Cut all the pivot rods with lenghts and quantity as described in the BOM (index 15-16)
4. Separate all the printed parts for each of the fingers where each number is the index in the BOM;

Pinky: 2 – 6 – 4 – 5

Ring finger: 2 – 6 – 4 – 5

Middle finger: 1 – 6 – 4 – 5

Index finger: 1 – 6 – 4 – 5 - 13 - 10 - 18

Thumb: 3 – 6 – 8 – 10 – 9 - 12

The assembly of the fingers is done with rods that are used as pivots in the joints. The servos' moving lever are fixed on the 3D printed levers with nails. The nail's head holds the lever in place and the other end is press fitted into the 3d printed lever.

Assembly of the pinky finger:
1. Attach part 2 and 6 with a 14mm pin. The assembly should be able to move freely.
2. Attach part 2 and 4 together with a 14mm pin.
3. Screw a Servo on part 6.
4. Attach part 5 and 6 with a 14mm pin.
5. With a nail, attach part 4 to the servo screwed on part 6.
6. Screw a servo on part 7.
7. With a nail, attach part 5 to the servo screwed on part 7.

For the four other fingers follow the same steps as for the pinky finger using the parts specified earlier.

When the fingers are assembled, the servo holders are cliped on the palm and a rod is inserted in the pivot.

Assembly of the base:
8. Install the motors drive on the back of the hand with the four bolts of index 29.
9. Make all the electric connections relating to the hand motors as explained in the electric README.
10. Insert a rod of index 26 into the forearm (index 20) until the exposed part of the rod is roughly the same length as the thickness of the base.
11. With the bolts of index 28, install the Open CR and the raspberry pi on the forearm.
12. Insert one of the Dynamixel in the cage located on the forearm until the rotating circle is level with the exterior of the cage.
13. Fasten the 3D printed piece of index 23 to the Dynamixel installed in step 24 using 2 bolts of index 27.
14. Insert the other Dynamixel in the rectangular enclosure in the base, and fasten the gear of index 21 to said Dynamixel using 2 bolts of index 27.
15. Insert 2 bearings of index 22 in the circular grooves in the base.
16. Place the protruding rod of the forearm into the hols in the base, making sure that the gear installed in step 26 and the gear of the forearm mesh together.
17. Connect the hand to the forearm using a rod of index 25, making sure that the driver side of the palm faces the Dynamixel in the forearm.
18. Install the wrist lever arm (index 24) between the forearm dynamixel and the protruding hole at the bottom of the palm.
19. Connect the Dynamixels as explained in the electric README.
If desired, you can screw a wooden platform to the base for added stability.
